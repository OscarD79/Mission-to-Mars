# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project was to complete 4 tasks:

* Scrape Data off of a Web Page
* Add the data to a MongoDB Database
* Use Flask to build a Web Page using the MongoDB data
* Stylize the Web Page using Bootstrap
<br>
## Files
<br>
The completed assignment required the completion of 4 files.

<br>
The first step was to build the structure where by we would scrape the data using the following python file:

<br>

[Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.py](Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.py)

<br>
The next step was to create the code to scrape the data and save it to the Database, which was completed with the following python file:

<br>

[scraping.py](scraping.py)

<br>
The next step was to set up Flask to build our HTML page and pull the data from MongoDB using PyMongo using the following python file:

<br>

[app.py](app.py)

<br>
Lastly there is the index.html file created by Flask:

<br>

[index.html](./templates/index.html)

<br>

## What does the web page look like?
